Description: Causal loop diagrams are a valuable tool for the
        structuring of complex problems. The cld package provides a
        domain specific lanuage (DSL) allowing to import CLDs from
        Vensim to R in order to enrich them with suitable meta
        information so that the CLDs can be published as small web
        applications or RMarkdown reports.
