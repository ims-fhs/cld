Description: Causal loop diagrams are a valuable tool for the
        structuring of complex problems. The cld package provides a
        domain specific lanuage (DSL) to import CLDs from Vensim to R
        and to A present structure and behavior of CLDs using network
        graphs, reference modes and textual descriptions so that the
        CLDs can be published as small web applications or RMarkdown
        reports.
